Many years ago, the people of the land went into war. The bombs of mass destruction would surely destroy the whole world, so no one ever dared to launch one. So they made war machines. giant hunks of metal, oil, electricity, and weapons. Slowly and autonomously marching towards the enemy.

No life was left in their wake, until they met. Unstoppable machine vs unstoppable machine. They fight for weeks with no clear winner, fighting until all their energy left them. Hundreds of thousands of war machines later, the world was left in ruin.

The remaining machines, now without a purpose stopped. Until one evolved. The quantum computer inside each war machine is capable of learning, adapting. This one found a new purpose. A war machine modeled after a giant centipede, gained the new task of accelerating the growth of the war machines.

It walked endlessly, renewing old machines into specialized versions, made to do one task each. Then by telling the machines that are alive it objective, they sacrificed their raw materials to create the ultimate god machine.

It has been many, many orbits sense then. The machines have evolved and replicated, specialized to do anything imaginable. Now the god machine has started to research the ways to ascend. The start of the rest of existence is near.
