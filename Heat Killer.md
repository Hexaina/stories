You watch the stars, shining almost as bright as the moon so familiar. They are always still, always predictable, always in the same spots every season. the night sky calms you as it has many many times before. 

The stars start moving. They move apart scattering farther and farther apart.

They keep going and going. Then you see the brightest objects in the sky leave. Jupiter, Uranus, Mars, and then the moon. All drifting away. The sun starts to get dimmer and dimmer. Everything goes cold. It gets hard to breath, like the air goes out of your lungs.

You see every part of your body start to separate, first your arms, then your legs, your body fades away, and you see your head drift away and disappear. Your no longer breathing. You look down on yourself and the is nothing left. you cant move, there's nothing around you to move through.

You can still think, but your thoughts start to quiet down. Everything is dark. There is nothing left. 

You lose your ability to comprehend time. 

It feels like you are asleep. 

It feels like you are dead, you are not.

A figure of space darker them the darkest black appears. Its appearance doesn't matter, and you cant see it anyway. You start to hear, at least that's what you think is happening. A low rumble, almost to low to hear. a voice calls out, "Your welcome".

"Your kind has been hear for a very short time. The matter you once knew is gone now. Thankfully I'm here to immortalize things. Putting every of the smallest fundamental things in their own spaces. It wont take long for them to be far apart enough that i don't have to wade through it."

You think all the worst things you can at this moment, you use all the energy you think you have. "There's nothing to worry about, every sentient being still exists, thinking and seeing. It will only take an eternity to fade away slowly."

You can now feel the comfort of the figure, like a nice cold departure. Naturally you can only be happy anymore. You wait for what seems like time, but nothing happens ever again.
